            At IMAGINE Lab, our research is focused on studying if music listening and playing have a positive impact on
            the emotions and social
            connectedness of people with Alzheimer Disease (AD) as well as their caregivers. Combining music with
            science and technology, our
            interdisciplinary team plans to use electroencephalography (EEG) data to explore the neurological effects
            related to music therapy interventions,
            specifically how individuals with AD store and retrieve musical memories.
            <br></br>
                Current brain imagining research has indicated that music therapy can lead to decreased levels of
                depression and pain perception,
                as well as increased social engagement for typical adults with AD. Our research team hopes to further
                examine how music can improve physical coordination,
                social interaction, and emotional experiences for individuals diagnosed with AD.
            <br></br>
                Our research team is collectively passionate about helping those who treat or have Alzheimer Disease.
                Our goal is to apply findings from our study to
                help music therapists develop more effective music interventions for their patients with AD. We also
                hope that these findings will help design training
                programs for caregivers to teach them how using music-based strategies can support positive
                relationships and connectedness with a person with AD.</p>
