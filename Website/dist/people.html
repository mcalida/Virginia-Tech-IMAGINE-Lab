                    Doug Harrison is a graduate student in the department of psychology pursuing a doctorate of
                    psychology focused in developmental science. His research interests include the development of
                    executive functions and cognitive control, their interaction with learning, and neurophysiological
                    correlates of this relationship. His research goals are to translate laboratory findings to
                    individualized and adaptive education. <br>

                    Doug joined the IMAGINE lab to gain more experience with clinical populations, explore interests in
                    lifespan development, and hyperscanning methods. He hopes to leverage knowledge gained from this
                    experience to future translational work for skill learning and retention, and social learning.
